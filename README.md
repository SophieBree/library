# Library App
This is a portfolio project to showcase my skills as a developer, but also to provide a useful utility for those wishing to track their books. The app offers:

1. Easy, vibrant card based design for your book collection
2. Pin books to access them later in the 'Pinned Books' menu
3. Mark books as read so you keep track of your reading

Upcoming features/changes:

- Optimised site for mobile
- Edit button for books
- Minor design tweaks
