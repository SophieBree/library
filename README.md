# Front-end Library App

## Main Points
This was an independent project to test my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is a basic library app that allows users to add books, pin them, and mark them as read.

It also lets the user see a filtered view of only the books they have pinned, read, or both.

I tested my CSS and JavaScript knowledge when creating this by adding a button to toggle the book view between list and grid.

The app also saves the books, as well as their read/pinned status in localStorage.
